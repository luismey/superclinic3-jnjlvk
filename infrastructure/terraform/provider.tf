# Provider configuration notes:
# - Uses SÃ£o Paulo region (southamerica-east1) by default for Brazilian market focus
# - Implements retry mechanism for improved reliability (RTO 4 hours requirement)
# - Enables user_project_override for proper resource hierarchy management
# - Supports both production and staging environments through var.project_id
# - Configured for high availability with proper timeout settings
